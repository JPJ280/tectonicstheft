if MEP is such a general principle, seems like you should be able to find a way to account for constraints and still use it (e.g. where I0-I1 ~ I0 )
if structures form that increase entropy production moreso than "dissipative soup", why reduce atmospheric model to a dissipative soup? Couldn't MEP be used to create a better description of convection?
kleidon and fraedrich, Toniazzo et al., same book as Dewar 2005, for use of MEP with biosphere-climate interactions

if system obeys a balance equation:
∂ρ/∂t = -∇⋅F + Q
local change in heat density = convergence of flux + net local heat source
i.e. local change in temp = convergence of thermal energy flux F + sum of insolation and geothermal heat 
then:
1.) MAXENT states there will be some entropy production (EP) as function of flux F and source Q, and
2.) analogues of MEP, FT, and SOC (Dewar 2003)


EP = ∫ᵥ (F̄⋅∇θ + θQ̄) ∂V where θ is analogue of inverse temperature, overbar indicates time average, and V is system volume max occurs where:
MEP occurs where: 0 = ∂/∂yᵢ  ∫ᵥ (F̄⋅∇θ + θQ̄) ∂V, where y is parameter space
MEP occurs where: 0 = ∂/∂yᵢ  ∫ᵥ (F̄ᵢ∂θ/∂xᵢ + θQ̄) ∂V, where y is parameter space

For a conserved energy flux:
MEP occurs where: 0 = ∂/∂yᵢ  ∫ᵥ Fθ ∂V, where y is parameter space and ∫ᵥF = 0
where T is highest, θ is lowest, and you want F to be as deep into the negative values as possible
where T is lowest, θ is highest, and you want F to be as deep into the posistive values as possible
in other words, F ultimately depends on temperature, not heat flux Q (aka insolation I)
